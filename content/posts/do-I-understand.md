Growing older, I'm beginning to realise that I don't understand some concepts that I thought I understood fairly well. _"I don't understand"_ might be a bit too much. A verb or two are missing : _'I think/feel I don't understand'_.

Consider the use of English's 'but'. These days when I encounter 'but' in a sentence, most of the time I will reflexively ask myself "Is this the right way to use 'but'? It seems out of place. A 'but' is normally used for contrast but (hmm...) I don't see any contrast between the two clauses." The kicker here is I definitely understand what the person is trying to say.

Thus, the dissonance: if I can understand what the person is trying to say with 'but', then why is it that I think or feel that I do not understand what he's saying (or at least, I do not understand why he uses the conjunction that way)?

Is this some mangled form of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder? It seems like it is. I've studied various resources on 'but' but (hmm...) rarely do I feel that I understood the conjunction. I often have these mini self-teaching sessions in which I give myself explanations and examples on 'but' usage; still, the needle of understanding refuses to budge.

I guess this possibly pseudo-OCD is one out of the many weird curses that I'll have to deal with.

But oh well...I'll probably write more about the insanity of deciphering 'but's within sentences.
